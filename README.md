### Description of signals in ALU:

| Signal | Width | In/Out | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clock  | 1     | In     | A positive edge clock signal used to operate stateâ€™s transition. |
| A      | 8     | In     | The first operand of ALU                                         |
| B      | 8     | In     | The second operand of ALU                                        |
| Sel    | 4     | In     | Control signal used to select operator (Add, subtract, and, or)  |
| Out    | 8     | Out    | The result of ALU after performing selected operation            |
| Zero   | 1     | Out    | The zero flag activated when the output result equals 0          |

## Functional Implementation

The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is capable of performing 8-bit operations, including arithmetic addition and subtraction, as well as bitwise AND and OR operations.

Inputs:

- Input A (8 bits)
- Input B (8 bits)
- Control Signal (4 bits)

Outputs:

- Output Result (8 bits)
- Zero Flag (1 bit)

Operation Control Value Mapping:

- ADD: 0010
- SUB: 0110
- AND: 0000
- OR: 0001
